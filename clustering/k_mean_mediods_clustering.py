K-means and K-medoids are both popular clustering algorithms used in machine learning and data mining. 
They are similar in that they aim to group similar data points together, but they differ in their approach to forming clusters and 
their sensitivity to outliers.

K-means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm. 
It works by randomly initializing K cluster centroids and iteratively updating them until convergence. 
The algorithm assigns each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance and 
then recomputes the centroids based on the mean of the data points in each cluster. K-means seeks to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned centroids. One drawback of K-means is that it is sensitive to outliers since a single outlier can significantly affect the position of the centroid.

K-medoids, on the other hand, is a representative-based clustering algorithm. 
Instead of using the mean as a representative, it uses actual data points from the dataset as medoids. 
Medoids are chosen as the most centrally located points within each cluster, minimizing the dissimilarity between data points and 
the medoid. This dissimilarity is typically measured using metrics like Manhattan distance or other suitable dissimilarity measures. 
K-medoids is often preferred over K-means when dealing with categorical or non-numeric data, as it can handle arbitrary distance or 
dissimilarity measures.

In summary, the main differences between K-means and K-medoids are:

1. Centroids vs. Medoids: K-means uses the mean (centroid) of data points as representatives, while K-medoids uses actual data points (medoids) from the dataset as representatives.

2. Sensitivity to Outliers: K-means is sensitive to outliers because it uses the mean, which can be significantly affected by outliers. K-medoids, on the other hand, is more robust to outliers since it selects actual data points as representatives.

3. Dissimilarity Measures: K-means relies on Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure, whereas K-medoids can utilize various distance or dissimilarity measures, such as Manhattan distance or other user-defined metrics.

The choice between K-means and K-medoids depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the problem. K-means is generally efficient and widely used for numeric data, while K-medoids is often preferred for handling categorical or non-numeric data and dealing with outliers.
